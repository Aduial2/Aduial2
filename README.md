- 👋 Hi, I’m @Aduial2
- 👀 I’m interested in Web_Development (for now)
- 🌱 And i'm currently learning for it, it's just 4 months by now (12/04/2002), i started with the classic combo 'php, css, html, js and MySql', 
- 🌱 but i'm looking forward to evolve myself, maybe full js will be the way who knows

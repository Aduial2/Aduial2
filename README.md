- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Aduial2
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in webdevelpment for now
- ğŸŒ± And i'm currently learning for it, it's just 4 months by now (12/04/2002), i started with the classic combo 'php, css, html, js and MySql', 
- ğŸŒ± but i'm looking forward to evolve myself, maybe full js will be the way who knows
